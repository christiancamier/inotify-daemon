.TH INOTIFY-DAEMON.CONF 5 Jully 06 2020 "Linux Administrator's Manual"
.SH NAME
.B inotify-daemon.conf
\- inotify-daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRITION
.SS Global view
.BR inotify-daemon (8)
reads configuration data from
.I ${prefix}/etc/inotify-daemon.conf
(or the file specified with
.B -C
on the command line).
.PP
.SS File structure
The configuration file is an ASCII encoded text file.
.PP
Blank lines, or filled only with white characters, are ignored.
.PP
Lines whose first non-white character is a sharp (
.B #
) are ignored (comments).
.PP
Each line is a directive. A directive is a keyword followed by possible arguments.
Arguments are separated by one ore more spaces or tabs.
.PP
Some of these directives are sections (groups of directives).
.PP
A section begins with a line containing a section directive and ends with a line
containing only the key word
.B END
.PP
Some sections can be nested.
.PP
Example of a simple section:
.PP
.EX
directory /var/lib/input
   event close_write echo "New file %D/%F
end
.EE
.PP
Example of nested sections :
.PP
.EX
settings
  ...
  logging file
    set filename /var/log/inotify-daemon.log
    ...
  end
  ...
end
.EE
.PP
The main directives are :
.TP 15
.B SETTINGS
Single directive, usually in the header of the main configuration file, initiating a section
defining global behaviours
.BR inotify-daemon(8)
.TP
.B DIRECTORY
Directive defining a section in which, for a given directory, actions are specified
to be engaged when hosting events.
.TP
.B INCLUDE
Inclusion of files containing configuration tips.
.PP
.SH Types of arguments in directives
.SS Presentation
Some of directives take arguments with a spÃ©cific semantic
.PP
These arguments types are:
.PP
.TP 10
Booleans
.TP
Integers
.TP
Enumerated
.TP
Combinaison of enumerated
.SS Booleans arguments
Arguments of type booleens are used as switches. Possible values are
.B true
ans
.B false.
.BR
To designate these values in the configuration file, the possibilities are as follows:
.TP 12
for true
.B ON TRUE YES
.TP
for false
.B OFF FALSE NO
.SS Integers arguments
Some directives require that one or more of its arguments be a positive integer value.
.PP
These values can be in octal, decimal or hexadecimal.
.PP
If the indicated value begins with a zero (0), the value will be interpreted as octal.
.PP
If the indicated value begins with 0x, the value will be interpreted as hexadecimal.
.PP
All other value will be interpreted as decimal.
.PP
For example, for the value (10)d, possibilities are as follow:
.PP
.TP 20
decimal
.B 10
.TP
octal
.B 012
.TP
hexadecimal
.B 0x0a
or
.B 0x0A
.SS Enumerated arguments
Some directives require one or more arguments of a listed type. An argument of this type awaits
therefore a value belonging to a predefined list.
.PP
In this case, refer to the directive for possible values.
.PP
Enumerated arguments are case insensitive.
.SS Combinaison of enumerated
Some directives, which require that one or more of its arguments be chosen from among values
predefined, accept combinations of these values.
.PP
In this case, the different values are placed one after the other, separated by a
comma (
.B ,
) or by a pipe (
.B |
)
withour spaces or tabs.
.PP
For example, for the directive "event":
.EX
event close_write|close_nowrite echo "file %D/%F closed" >&2
event close_write,close_nowrite echo "file %D/%F closed" >&2
.EE
.SH The SETTINGS directive
.SS Presentation

management of events on directories) are defined.
.SS SETTINGS sub directives
SETTINGS sub directivs are the following:

two arguments:
.TP 10
.B option
The option name
.TP
.B valeur
The option value
.PP
For more information refet to the "Logging management" section.
